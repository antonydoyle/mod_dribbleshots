mod_dribbleshots
================

A simple Joomla module for displaying your Dribbble shots on your site.

Fully tested on Joomla 2.5.4 and works as desired! 

Basic configuration options allow changing of username and number of shots. CSS can also be loaded / unloaded, as can jQuery - so if you're already using jQuery, you can turn it off in the module.

Makes use of jQuery and heavy lifting is done by jribble - https://github.com/tylergaw/jribbble - saved me a lot of effort! So, thanks to Tyler Gaw for that.
